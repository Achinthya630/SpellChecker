The project - “Spell Checker” redefines spell checking through the strategic 
integration of the Wagner-Fischer algorithm and multithreading principles. Unlike 
traditional spell-checking systems that often struggle with processing speed and 
computational efficiency, our approach introduces an innovative method to enhance 
the accuracy and performance of spell correction. 
The project leverages the Wagner-Fischer algorithm to calculate edit distances 
efficiently, optimizing the spell-checking process. Multithreading is employed to 
parallelize the computation, ensuring faster processing times and improved 
scalability. This combination addresses common limitations in existing spellchecking systems, such as high latency and inadequate handling of large text 
volumes. Our solution not only overcomes these challenges but also sets a new 
standard for efficient and accurate spell checking. This report delves into the design, 
implementation, and evaluation of our spell-checking system, highlighting its key 
features, advantages over existing methods, and its potential to advance the field of 
text processing
